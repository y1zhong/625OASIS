# Dementia Diagnosis Classification

## Background
This project is the final project of BIOSTAT 625 [_Computing with Big Data_](https://sph.umich.edu/academics/courses/course.php?courseID=BIOSTAT625) fall 2021. 
In this neuroimaging classification project, we apply multiple representative methods to predict Alzheimer's status, for example, Logistic(Ridge&Lasso), LDA, SVM, Random forest, Naive bayes and CNN.

## Summary
This repository contains all the works for classification and interactive data visualization. For more details, please refer to our [project report](https://github.com/y1zhong/625OASIS/blob/main/Biostat625_Final.pdf) and our [Shiny app](https://github.com/y1zhong/625OASIS/blob/main/shiny/app.R).

## Model result
Preliminary results are listed below:

|  Model   | Lasso  | Ridge | LDA | SVM-L | RF | NB |
|  ----  | ----  | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Sensitivity  | 0.60 | 0.60 | 0.63 | 0.49 | 0.65 | ??? |
